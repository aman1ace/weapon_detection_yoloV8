Weapon Detection using YOLOv8
Developed a real-time weapon detection system using YOLOv8 to identify firearms
such as AK-47s, pistols, and knives. A custom dataset of 2,000+ images was collected
and annotated in YOLO format. The model was trained and optimized for fast
inference on CPU and GPU, delivering accurate bounding boxes and class
predictions. Integrated detection with live video streams for immediate threat
recognition. The project demonstrates practical computer vision skills, deep learning
expertise, and the ability to solve real-world security problems, making it highly
relevant for defense, surveillance, and AI-focused internship opportunities.
